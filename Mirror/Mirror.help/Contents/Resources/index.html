            Mirror is a web-scraper/spider allowing you to backup (<i>'mirror'</i>) websites for offline use.
            <br>This could prove useful if you want to have a backup of some website or copy a website that may be shut down.

                To start mirroring a link, enter one in the project window and press enter.
                The application starts mirroring automatically, reporting on the number of bytes that have been received and written to disk, the transfer rate, ...
                You can add more links. They are kept by the project and mirrored when deemed appropriate.
                <br><br>Files that are being downloaded (or have been downloaded), errors, and warnings are displayed in the statistics window which can be accessed by clicking <span class="menu-tag">View > Show Statistics</span>.
                <br>
                A project can be paused and its files can be browsed through. Its contents can be saved <i>'as is'</i> (with the structure format chosen in the project options), or as a bundle.
                The latter behaviour can be altered in the global app preferences, which can be accessed through the application's main menu (<span class="menu-tag">Mirror > Preferences...</span>).

                The app includes many options, including :
                <ul>
                    <li><span><i>Spider</i> : alter the ways robots.txt files are treated, parse JAVA files, accept cookies, attempt to parse links even in javascript or other tags, ...</span></li>
                    <li><span><i>Limit</i> : set the maximum mirroring depth (both internal and external), the maximum size of non-HTML or HTML files that are to be mirrored, the maximum size of the mirror,
                        the maximum time spent mirroring, the maximum transfer rate, the maximum connections/second, the maximum number of links, ...</span></li>
                    <li><span><i>Download</i> : set the maximum number of connections, the timeout length, the number of retries (when the app fails to download a file), the minimum transfer rate, ....</span></li>
                    <li><span><i>Identity</i> : use a proxy, set up the default referrer URL, set up HTTP headers, ...</span></li>
                    <li><span><i>Build</i> : create log files, use a cache, alter the structure of the resulting copy, make an index, ...
                        (websites can be downloaded 'as is' or can also be encapsulated in document files)</span></li>
                </ul>
                These options can be set by clicking <span class="menu-tag">View > Show Options</span>. This opens a window with project options, where most options are described by their tooltip -
                you know, that little popup that becomes visible once you hover over something.
                <br>It is also possible to save your custom options as a preset. To do so, make sure the options window is active, and use the <span class="menu-tag">Project > Options > Save Preset...</span> menu.
