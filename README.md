A Cocoa app that mirrors websites (for offline use). The app makes use of [HTTrack](https://github.com/xroche/httrack) v.3.48-21, with some modifications annotated with `MIRROR_ADAPTATION`.

It is available in the App Store, but you can compile it for free with XCode.

## How to Use

Just open up the app, type in an URL, press enter. The rest should be fairly obvious. Bug reports are very welcome.
