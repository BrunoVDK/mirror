A Cocoa app that mirrors websites (for offline use). The app makes use of [HTTrack](https://github.com/xroche/httrack) v.3.48-21, with some modifications that are annotated with `MIRROR_ADAPTATION`.

You can compile it for free with XCode. It's still a work in progress, by the way.

## How to Use

Launch the application, enter any website you want to mirror, and press enter. Before mirroring you can change options (command-O) and during the mirroring you can get an overview of warnings and errors (command-L). Bug reports are very welcome.
